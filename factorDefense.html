	    <p> Circles with numbers on them will come in waves and move along a path.  Your goal is to destroy 
	    them before they get to the end of the path.  If a circle gets to the end, you will lose as many lives as
	    the number on the circle.  When you run out of lives, the game is over. You can set up turrets to attack 
	    the circle by clicking on squares adjacent to the path. Each turrent starts out with a value of 2.  
	    Any time this turret senses a circle adjacent to its location, it will attack.  If the circle's number
	    is divisible by 2, the number will be divided by 2. Otherwise, nothing happens.  This works the same way
	    for any prime number.  When a circle's number becomes 1, the circle is destroyed.  If you click on an
	    existing turret, it will increase its number to the next prime. Building a new turret costs 10 money, 
	    and upgrading a turret costs 5.  You earn 1 money every time you destroy a circle.
	    </p>
	    <p> If you make it far enough, you may see circles with negative numbers. (if a negative number makes it to
	    the end, you lose the absolute value of that number of lives).  The highest prime that can occur is 97, so
	    if you upgrade a turret that has a value of 97, it becomes -1.  If you upgrade a -1, it wraps around back to 2.
	    Each turret has a cooldown time.  Each turret will also attack every circle in every adjacent square (not
	    counting diagonals) every time it chooses to shoot, and it will also shoot at the first circle it sees.  So
	    if you have a 2 turret and a 2 circle is following right behind a 3 circle, the turret will shoot at the 3
	    circle (which does nothing), and then it might miss the 2 circle due to its cooldown time if they are
	    following very close together.
	    </p>
	    <p> After a wave has ended, the "Start Next Wave" button will be clickable. The next wave will not start
	    until you click on it. You earn a point every time a turret successfully decreases a circle's number. Also,
	    the first round will only have 2's and 3's.  The rounds get harder as you go.
